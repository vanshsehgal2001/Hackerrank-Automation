# Hackerrank-Automation

It's a small demo of automation of Hackerrank. In this small task, I automated the whole process of choosing a question,coding it and submitting it on the
hackerrank purely through automation. For now, it works for only one specific question and a particular solution for that question as it was for practice
work and really I learned a lot from this activity.

# Future Plans

-> To automate it for multiple questions.
-> Submit multiple solutions to a particular question.
-> Make it a multi-tab automated system. Like submitting various questions at the same time in different tabs.
